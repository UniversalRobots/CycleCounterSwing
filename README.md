# CycleCounterSwing
URCap sample that mainly demonstrates the principle of Variable, VariableFactory and ExpressionBuilder

Cycle Counter Swing demonstrates how to work with variables. In this example, the chosen variable will be incremented each time the program node is executed.

This sample also demonstrates how to allow the end user to use the builtin PolyScope support for starting from and pausing/breaking on a selected program node in the program tree. In this case, the end user can start from or break on any child node under the Cycle Counter (URCap) program node.

Note:
* Support for allowing the end user to start from and break on child nodes is only available from URCap API version 1.9.0 (released with PolyScope version 5.6.0)

Information: 
* Available from:
  * URCap API version 1.3.0.
  * PolyScope version 3.6.0/5.0.4.

Main API interfaces: Variable, VariableFactory, ExpressionBuilder
